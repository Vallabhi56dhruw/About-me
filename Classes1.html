  <h2 style="text-align:center;">My Expectations from these Courses</h2>
  
 <div> 
  
    <dt><b>Discrete Mathematics</b></dt>
	<dd>Concepts and notations from discrete mathematics will help in studying and describing objects and problems in branches of computer science,
    	such as computer algorithms, programming languages and software development.</dd><br>
	<dt><b>Computer Architecture & System Software</b></dt>
	<dd>Computer architecture and Organization focuses on the function and design of various components necessary to process information digitally.
       	The study of computer architecture and organization focuses on the interface between hardware and software, and emphasizes the structure and
		behavior of the system. So it will help me to explore how machines are designed, built, and operate.</dd><br>
	<dt><b>Data Structure</b></dt>
	<dd>Data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.
	After studying it, my problem-solving abilities will improve.</dd><br>
	<dt><b>Operating System</b></dt>
	<dd>Operating system is an interface between the user and the computer hardware. It controls the execution of application software and manages
	    the computer hardware.There are multiple reasons to behind the study of operating system . Some of them are given below :
	<ul>
	<li>To learn about system design so that we can extend the features of operating system.</li>
	<li>To solve any problem occurring in operating system.</li>
	<li>To learn how to manage the computer resources appropriately.</li>
	</ul></dd>
	<dt><b>C Programming</b></dt>
	<dd>C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on.
	Here every concept is taught in depth. So learning 'C' as the main language will help me to learn other programming languages, as it shares the same concepts such as data types,
	operators, control statements and many more. It is a simple language and provides faster execution.</dd><br>
	<dt><b>Business Communication</b></dt>
	<dd>It's main purpose is to improve organizational practices, eliminate silos, keep employees informed and reduce errors. Effective business communication
	is essential for success and growth of every organization. It will help me to understand the concepts of good and bad communications, to both internal and external audiences.</dd><br>
    <dt><b>Web Development Lab-I</b></dt>
	 <dd>Web development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet.
	It will help me to learn to develop or design web pages.</dd><br>
    <dt><b>Programming Lab in C</b></dt>
	 <dd>Here we learn Programming In C Langugae Practically. It help  to learn different programs related to different concepts in C.</dd><br>
